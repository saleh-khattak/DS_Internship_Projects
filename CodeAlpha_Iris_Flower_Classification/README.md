# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification System

## 📌 Internship Machine Learning Project

This project implements a machine learning classification system to predict the species of Iris flowers (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**) based on flower measurements.  
The system is built using **Scikit-learn** and includes an **interactive user interface** developed with **Streamlit**.
